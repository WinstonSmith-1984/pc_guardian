**LOTL-LAN** is a tactical internal network monitoring and threat intelligence suite designed to detect **Living off the Land** (LOTL) attack vectors within a Local Area Network. By focusing on East-West traffic and protocol-specific anomalies (LLMNR, NBNS, MDNS, ARP), LOTL-LAN provides security analysts with real-time visibility into lateral movement and internal poisoning attempts.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Active Threat Intelligence**: Automatically analyzes protocol frequency for lateral pivot patterns and escalates alerts to the System Security Status window.
* **East-West Threat Window**: A dedicated, scrollable log that deduplicates and tracks unique internal connection strings.
* **Protocol Decoder**: Deep-dive intelligence on discovery protocols used in NTLM relay and spoofing attacks.
* **Tactical HUD**: Includes a 5s stabilized refresh for zero-flicker UI, CSV export for forensic documentation, and a real-time Security Status Grid for ARP and scanning monitoring.

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Dependencies & System Requirements
* **Python 3.9+**
* **Core Libraries**: Streamlit (HUD), PyShark (TShark wrapper), Plotly, and Pandas.
* **Host Requirements**: TShark (Wireshark) must be installed, and Root/Admin privileges are required for promiscuous mode packet capture.
